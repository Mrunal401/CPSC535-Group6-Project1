###Algo - Neema (and Asad?)
Version 1 Due Date: Saturday Feb 3rd
Module Name(s): (Neema/Asad: what module name should Mrunal be importing in her main gui code? )
Librarys needed: (Neema/Asad: what non-standard librarys will people need to instal to run this code. ex: matplotlib)
Funtion/Class Definitions: (Neema/Asad: what functions/classes should Mrunal be calling in her main gui code and what do they do?: 
        1) name of each funciton/class (ex: bubble_sort(arr)
        2  description (ex: sorts a List of unsorted integers using the Bubble Sort algo. Returns a new sorted List
        3) input (ex: param1 "arr" = a List of unsorted integers
        4) output (ex: a List of sorted integers)

### Visualizaion - Akshay

Funtion/Class Definitions: (Neema: what are the function or class definitions: 
        1) name of each funciton/class (ex: bubble_sort(arr)

### GUI - Mrunal
Version 1 Due Date: Saturday Feb 3rd
Module Name(s): (Mrunal)
Librarys needed: (Mrunal: what non-standard librarys will people need to instal to run this code. ex: tkinter or pillow)
Notes on using the Gui: (murnal) 

###Doumentation - Adam
Version 1 Due Date: Sunday Feb 4th

##Tests Cases - Adam/Brandon/Others?
for Algos - This could be a Module with coded unit tests (ex code that calls each sorting algo function with a known array and compares that array to presorted array to verify proper sorting)
for GUi/Visualization - Mabye this is just a description of manual tests performed (data entered through gui, expected output and observed output - including edge cases (?)
